This file is meant to simply keep track of pages I may want to specifically go back to and read later for a reference.

Chapter 0: None
Chapter 1:
  - Page 11 [%f, decimals, and other %<character> meanings.]
  - Page 14 [File copying, character counting, word counting, text manipulation, etc.]


Notes:
- I skipped Execercise 1-9 because it was a question rather than a coding problem.
