This file is meant to simply keep track of pages I may want to specifically go back to and read later for a reference.

~ Please note: 
This is the 1st edition of The C Programming Language!
If you are looking at exercises, it is strongly recommended you look specifically for the 2nd edition solutions.

Chapter 0: None
Chapter 1:
  - Page 11 [%f, decimals, and other %<character> meanings.]
  - Page 14 [File copying, character counting, word counting, text manipulation, etc.]


Notes:
- I skipped Exercise 1-9 because it was a question rather than a coding problem.
- I am skipping Exercise 1-12 with the intent on returning and solving it vertically.
