Programming_Books
=================

This is a repository of some of the programming books I am currently reading and the programs I have made while following their examples, exercises, and so forth.

Please feel free to ask me any questions. If you see a book on here that looks interesting, please go buy a copy and check it out; I only upload examples from books I've enjoyed or learned a lot from.

Please note: These repositories may not contain all of the exercises, examples, and so forth in the book. I skip some that are too easy / boring sometimes, other times I may skip one because it's too difficult or any other reason. Whatever I do post, however, I fully understand. So if you have any questions please feel free to contact me!
