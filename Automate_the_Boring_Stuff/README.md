<BR>
Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number. If number is even, then collatz() should print number // 2 and return this value. If number is odd, then collatz() should print and return 3 * number + 1.

Then write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps calling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1.
<BR>


<strong>Chapter 4 (1 of 2): [Comma Code](https://github.com/ArnoldM904/Programming_Books/blob/master/Automate_the_Boring_Stuff/Chapter_004/Practice_Problems/Comma_Code.py)</strong>
<BR>
Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with and inserted before the last item. 
<BR>

Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password string it is passed is strong. A strong password is defined as one that is at least eight characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, and has at least one digit.
<BR>


<strong>Chapter 7 (2 of 2): <a href="https://github.com/ArnoldM904/Programming_Books/blob/master/Automate_the_Boring_Stuff/Chapter_007/Practice_Problems/Regex_Version_of_Strip().py">Regex Version of strip()</a></strong>
<BR>
Write a function that takes a string and does the same thing as the strip() string method. If no other arguments are passed other than the string to strip, then whitespace characters will be removed from the beginning and end of the string. Otherwise, the characters specified in the second argument to the function will be removed from the string.
<BR>


<strong>Chapter 8 (1 of 3): <a href="">Extending the Multiclipboard</a></strong>
