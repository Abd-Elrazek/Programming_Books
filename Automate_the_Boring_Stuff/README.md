<strong> Chapter 3 (1 of 1): The Collatz Sequence </strong>
<BR>
Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number. If number is even, then collatz() should print number // 2 and return this value. If number is odd, then collatz() should print and return 3 * number + 1.

Then write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps calling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1.
<BR>

<strong>Chapter 4 (1 of 2): Comma Code</strong>
<BR>
Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with and inserted before the last item.
